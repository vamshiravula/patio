    <h1><a href="#">Building Your Own Concrete Patio</a></h1>
    <p class = "intro">You’ve come to the right place for a beginner’s guide in patio making. So, let’s get started! With any good outdoor project, you will want to begin with familiarizing yourself with the lay of the land and figure out the ideal placement of your concrete pad. You do not want to mess this up! Based on where your pad sits, you will want to select either of the small, medium, or large example sizes to determine the amount of material you need. The instructions are listed below along with the descriptions of each patio size. You will find that the instructions encompass the same process for each of the patios.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Setting up your framework</h3>
            <p>Depending on your patio size, cut down your dimensional lumber to the respective lengths of your patio. For instance, if you chose our small patio, you will cut two of the 2inx4inx12ft pieces of lumber down to 10ft boards. Next, using your two 10ft and 12ft 2x4’s, build the 12x10 frame for your project. Layout the project frame you have created in your desired location to have a patio, and drive stakes into each corner of the measured area. Then trace the perimeter by connecting the stakes together with masons line.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Digging!</h3>
            <p>Begin excavating the area. Dig out six inches of ground evenly throughout your perimeter and compact the newly uncovered ground using a hand tamper.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Laying down gravel</h3>
            <p>Layer an even four inches of gravel throughout the excavated area and flatten it out using a hand tamper.</p>

        <div class = "description"> 
        <h3>Step 4: Adjusting your form</h3>
        <p>Place the wooden form you built back into its place. Next, drive stakes into the ground behind the frame and screw them into the frame. At this point, work the form stakes into a position where each side of the frame is level. Finally, determine which side of the patio will be ideal for water drainage, and create a very slight downward slope (standard slope: 1/8 inch per foot) leading to that side of the patio frame by adjusting the form stakes some more.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Making concrete</h3>
            <p>With wheelbarrow, cement bags, and a garden hose, prepare to mix the cement. Open a bag of mix and empty it into one side of the wheelbarrow. Fill the opposite side of the wheelbarrow with some water, and then begin to mix the ingredients together bit-by-bit. Mix the concrete with water until a consistent muddy appearance is present. The concrete mix should not be runny from over watering or dryish and crumbly from not enough moisture. Continue to mix and gingerly add water to the mix until ready to begin pouring.</p>

        <div class = "description">
            <h3>Step 6: Pouring</h3>
            <p>Begin pouring the wet concrete from the wheelbarrow into the wooden frame and spreading it throughout the area. Do not worry about low spots at this point, because those will be able to be back filled with excess concrete after screeding the area.</p>

        <div class = "description">
            <h3>Step 7: Evenly filling and flatting your pad</h3>
            <p>Once the patio area is filled with the wet concrete, you can begin the finishing process. Start by screeding over the top of the project area with your extra 2x4 piece of lumber. Drag the 2x4 across the top of the forms on either side of the project. Use the excess cement to refill low spots. Repeat this process until area is evenly filled and flat.</p>

        <div class = "description">
            <h3>Step 8: Finishing touches</h3>
            <p>With a concrete float, pass over the top of the wet cement until the surface is smooth. Next, by using the hand edging tool, trace the perimeter of the frame to round the top corner and separate the cement from the form boards. Continue to pass over the wet cement with the concrete float and a finishing trowel until satisfied with the appearance.</p>

            <h4>Additional Notes</h4>
            <p>If desired, it is often common to lightly run a bristle brush broom over the wet cement to create a texture pattern. Furthermore, the form boards can safely be removed from the new patio 1-2 weeks after the pour. Ensure your project has the desired outcome by lightly spraying the surface down 5 - 10 times a day with water for a week following the completion of the project. Properly hydrating the concrete during its curing process will increase the strength of the patio and prevent cracking.</p>
